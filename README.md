# 5-Key Piano Using TI TM4C123GXL Microcontroller

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 5-key piano using the Texas Instruments **TM4C123GXL microcontroller**. The project is written in **ARM assembly** and developed in **Keil MicroVision**. It features external buttons and a buzzer that plays different frequencies corresponding to the pressed buttons. LEDs are used for visual feedback.
Project Features

## How It Works

    Hardware Setup:
        Buttons are connected to Port E (PE1â€“PE5) and pull-up resistors are enabled internally.
        LEDs are connected to the respective button pins for visual feedback.
        A buzzer is connected to PE0.

    Software Functionality:
        Timers are initialized to generate precise delays for the square wave output.
        When a button is pressed, the corresponding frequency is generated on PE0, creating a square wave to drive the buzzer.
        LEDs light up to indicate which button is pressed.

    Frequency Mapping:
    Each button corresponds to a unique frequency:
        Button 1 (PE1): Frequency 1
        Button 2 (PE2): Frequency 2
        Button 3 (PE3): Frequency 3
        Button 4 (PE4): Frequency 4
        Button 5 (PE5): Frequency 5

## Requirements

    Hardware:
        TI TM4C123GXL microcontroller.
        5 external push-buttons.
        5 LEDs.
        1 buzzer.
        Resistors as needed.

    Software:
        Keil MicroVision IDE.
